Hey! I'm Thomas (TomÃ¡Å¡)
I'm a developer at AquaHub.GG, where I pour my passion and energy into making our projects the best they can be.
I'm responsible for scripting the core of our tools â€” the entire GUI was built purely through Lua code, no shortcuts,
no templates, just raw script and creativity. I made some sites for our script like https://aquahubgg.netlify.app

I take pride in writing clean, functional, and feature-rich code that powers the user experience.
Born and based in the Czech Republic, I'm always working to push boundaries and make AquaHub stand out in the community.

If it runs, glows, clicks, or explodes â€” there's a good chance I coded it. ðŸ˜„
